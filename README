Translatinator
==============
Like the Terminator, but for translations. Hasta la vista, Baby!

The target
==========
The target is to anihilate bad translations and make OpenSource projects more accessible to a wider and younger audience. Und das ist kostenlos! Watashi wa, ōpunsōsu no ga daisuki! Przyczyni się teraz! Kom igen nu, vi kan fixa detta! Eller hur? B-)

The Plan
========
The plan is to make a translation tool that have a webbased interface for “out-of-band” translations, this interface must be so simple that even a child can use it. The core principle should of course be that any attempt at a translation is better than none at all.

Each project assigns one person who is responsible for quality control of each language. This person does not have to be fluent in the language(s) (s)he have been assigned to, the community will vote for the best translations.

Also there will be a more or less advanced algorithm that also casts its own vote. This algorithm will take on a persona, my suggestion is that it shall be named “the Oracle” if no one can come up with a better.

The hidden agenda
=================
Yup, there ‘is’ one.. I want to become more fluent in different languages ;-D
